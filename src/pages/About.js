        <h1>üìú About the Skin Disease Detector</h1>

        <p>
          The <strong>Skin Disease Detector</strong> is a cross-platform AI-powered application designed to assist in the early identification of common skin conditions using image-based deep learning models.
          It is available both as a web application and a mobile app, making it accessible to users wherever they are.
        </p>

        <p>
          Users can upload a photo of a skin lesion or abnormality through their device‚Äôs camera or gallery. The app then analyzes the image using a deep learning model trained on thousands of dermatological images and returns a prediction of the most likely skin condition.
        </p>

        <h2>üì± Mobile + Web Access</h2>
        <p>
          The detector is fully responsive and optimized for mobile use. In addition, a dedicated mobile app version is available, providing native features such as camera integration, offline support (optional), and smoother performance on mobile devices.
        </p>

        <h2>üîç Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Real-time image-based disease prediction</li>
          <li>Compatible with both web browsers and mobile devices</li>
          <li>Simple and intuitive UI for quick use in clinical or personal settings</li>
          <li>Optional patient information storage for follow-up or offline review</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>üß† Powered by Deep Learning</h2>
        <p>
          The backend is powered by a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, such as ResNet or EfficientNet, trained on diverse datasets covering multiple skin diseases.
        </p>
